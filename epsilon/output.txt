Float sum up: 15.4037

Float sum down: 18.8079

Explain the difference.
In sum_up_float we start with a 'big' number. Therefore the last small digits in the last contribution will be ignored.
In sum_down_float we start with the small numbers and let the snowball up to 'big' numbers.

Does this sum converge as function of max?
Since it is a harmonic series it diverge

Double sum up: 21.3716

Double sum down: 21.3716

Explain the result of sum doubles.
The last digit of the smallest number is still within the range of the double.

a=2.4, b=2.6, tau=0.25 and epsilon=50: equals = 1
